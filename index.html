		  <p>Welcome to my website! I am currently a student at Oklahoma City Community College (OCCC).
		  My major is Computer Science with an emphasis in Computer Programming (A.A.S.), and this
		  website is being developed in CS 2513, Client-Side Programming. The purpose of this website
		  is to demonstrate the advantages of using Javascript on webpages. Javascript
		  is a very useful tool that allows web developers to make dynamic web sites. It can be used
		  to make animations, add interactivity with webpages, check user input on forms (validate it)
		  as well as a host of other things. Javascript also helps "clean up" webpage code, where if you
		  have many lines of code appearing in all HTML documents of a website, you can just put it into
		  one Javascript (.js) file, and apply it to all webpages to make that content appear on each
		  webpage.
		  
		  In fact, the header, logo and navigation of this website
		  is being displayed with the use of a Javascript source file (.js file). The same file will
		  be used to display that section for all subsequent webpages, similar to how one
		  .css file can be used to style multiple webpages.</p>
		  
		  <p>You will see various examples of Javascript usage on the following pages. For example, the
		  next page will display a working calculator, created with the help of Javascript.</p>
