This repository contains most of the files for the website I created while taking the client side programming course at Oklahoma City Community College (OCCC). It should give the viewer a good idea of what we covered in that course. Topics included dynamic HTML, forms and form processing, REGEX, error-checking, dynamic tables, usage of inner HTML and more. This website is not available online, but feel free to look through the files for code samples. I have also included the image files that are required for some of the pages to work.
